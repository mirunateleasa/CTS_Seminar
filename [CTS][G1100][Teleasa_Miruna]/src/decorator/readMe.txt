All the cases that the organizations try to solve are considered to be social cases. This means that, regardless of the specific purpose of the case, they will all be considered 
social in the beginning. However, there can also have a specific category, by which the organization can guide itself when choosing whether to solve a case or not. For example,
International Association for Refugees (IAFR) will always take only cases that concern refugees, because of its speciality. This specification is given to the case at the time it is reported
by a civilian, but there are cases in which the civilian reports the case incorrectly, so the case has to be able to be reverted to a basic case and then redecorated with a different
specification. Also, there can be cases that are reported as basic and can be taken by any organization, without having a specific category to be integrated into. Moreover, one case 
can have multiple specification, for example a Violence case can also be a Poverty case at the same time

I used the decorator for this specification because I needed to attach additional specification to the basic object only at compilation time. Also, I needed to be able to reverse back to
the basic case, if it was reported incorrectly and to be able to add a different functionality if it was the case.
