When it comes to taking a case, a worker checks the page with the reported cases and selects one that is according to his organization specific and his abilities. However, if
the chosen case involves more than 5 persons that are in need for help or it is estimated that, for the solving of the case, he will need more than 1000EUR as funds, he has to pass
the case to an admin, which is a more experienced worker. 
When an admin receives a case from a worker, he can directly take care of the case if that said case has more than 5 persons in need, but doesn't require more than 1000EUR to be 
solved. If it does, the admin has to pass the case to his superior, the manager, which can then decide, based on his experience, if the funds needed (more than 1000EUR) can be
allocated to the case and then start solving the case.

For this it was used the Chain of Responsability pattern because I needed to handle the case differently according to some specifications and also because there is a clear hierarchy
between employees, according to what type of case they are able to solve
