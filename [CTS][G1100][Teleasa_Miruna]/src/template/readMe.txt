When an admin is interested in taking a case, he has to go through a repetitive process in order to find a case that is both adapted to his speciality and accepted by his manager.
Thus, he has a template of actions that he must follow before starting to work on a case. The following are the steps he has to take:
	- He has to look for a case in the available cases
	- He has to send a request to his manager to approve the case
		- If the approval is not successful:
			- He has to look for another case
		- If the approval is successful
			- He has to officially start the case
			- He has to select workers to work on the case based on the available workers
			- After selecting the workers, he has to append them to the case and start the case

The best design pattern for this task was the template, because every case taking process needs a set of steps and rules that are similar and repetitive, so, even if the procedures
inside the process can be modified, the actual path to follow in order to take the case cannot change.
